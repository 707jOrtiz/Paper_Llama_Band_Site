                    Paper Llama is an American progressive rock band from California formed in 2017 under the name Just For Kicks(JFK) by Jake Druzgala and Jacob Ortiz. 
                    Though a number of lineup changes followed, in 2020, Matt Baker and "The Mysterioso Raven" joined the group and the band name was changed to Paper Llama. 
                    Yeah, that's right, covid couldn't stop these bois. In fact, Paper Llama happens to be the greatest band ever. Other bands wish they could be us. 
                    We are seriously that good.
                    If you wish to join and be as cool as us, and also happen to be a lead-guitar or keyboard player, feel free to contact us. 
                    We are trying to get in the Rock-N-Roll Hall of Fame and could seriously use another musician. With enough bribery, even you can join!
